Flask app for data driven website

This is a classic flask driven website.

This was based on what I learned from the [Talk Python Training Building Data-Driven Web Apps with Flask and SQLAlchemy Course](https://training.talkpython.fm/courses/explore_flask/building-data-driven-web-applications-in-python-with-flask-sqlalchemy-and-bootstrap) and lessons learned from building the [UEA glider groupo website](https://github.com/ueaglider/ueaglider-web).
