This was based on what I learned from the [Talk Python Training Building Data-Driven Web Apps with Flask and SQLAlchemy Course](https://training.talkpython.fm/courses/explore_flask/building-data-driven-web-applications-in-python-with-flask-sqlalchemy-and-bootstrap) and lessons learned from building the [UEA glider group website](https://github.com/ueaglider/ueaglider-web).

Some of the more interesting stuff is hidden behind a login for pilots eyes only. Sorry!
